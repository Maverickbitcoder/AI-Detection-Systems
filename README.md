# AI-Detection-Systems
A collection of AI-powered detection systems including message classification and news detection. Designed to be modular and scalable, this project will expand to include more models like phishing detection, sentiment analysis, and more in the future.
# 🤖 AI-Detection-Systems

Welcome to the **AI-Detection-Systems** repository — a growing collection of machine learning and AI models focused on detecting and classifying digital content. This project aims to provide efficient solutions to modern digital challenges such as detecting fake news, spam messages, phishing attempts, and more.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository currently includes:

- 🗞 **News Detection**: Detects fake vs real news articles using NLP and supervised learning algorithms.
- 💬 **Message Classification**: Identifies spam, offensive content, or other types of message anomalies.
- 🛡️ **Future Modules**: Planned additions include phishing URL detection, hate speech detection, sentiment analysis, etc.

Each module is modular and self-contained, making it easy to understand, modify, and expand.

## 📁 Dataset Source

For the fake news detection model, we used the following publicly available dataset:

> **Kaggle - Fake and Real News Dataset**  
> 📥 [Download Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/fake-news-classification)

This dataset contains over 40,000 real and fake news articles which are preprocessed and fed into NLP pipelines and ML models.
